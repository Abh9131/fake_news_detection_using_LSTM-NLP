Fake News Detection using Machine Learning, NLP AND lstm
This repository contains the implementation of a Fake News Detection system using Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. 
The project aims to classify news articles as Fake or Real based on their content.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization.
Deep Learning Model: LSTM-based architecture for handling sequential data.
Machine Learning Baselines: Models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest for comparison.
Interactive Visualization: Display of model performance metrics.
Dataset Handling: Supports various news datasets in CSV format.


Dependencies
Key dependencies include:

TensorFlow
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
NLTK
Matplotlib


Workflow:
Data Collection: Use publicly available datasets in CSV format.
Preprocessing: Clean and prepare textual data for model input.
Modeling: Train and evaluate the LSTM model along with baseline classifiers.
Deployment: Option to integrate into a web app or API for real-time predictions.
This project is ideal for researchers and developers interested in applying NLP and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems in misinformation detection.
